###### STORMS
Storms are impacted by climate change in the same way that some floods are, via the effect that higher temperatures have on evaporation and subsequent precipitation. With clouds holding increased amounts of water vapor, more powerful storms develop.

###### EXTREME TEMPERATURES
Climate change can lead to both extreme high temperatures and extreme low temperatures. The connection with extreme high temperatures is more intuitive — greenhouse gases are being trapped in the atmosphere and this leads to warming. However, the connection to extreme low temperatures can be harder for some people to make. Lower temperatures in some regions are a result of the polar vortex being warmer, causing it to weaken and dip down further than it normally would, bringing with it colder temperatures. This is further exacerbated by impacts to the jet stream that change the pattern of where and when hot and cold temperatures typically occur. These two combined have led to hotter summers and harsher winters in some areas.

###### LANDSLIDES
Landslides are connected to rainfall as well. Due to climate change’s impact on evaporation and precipitation, more frequent and intense rainfall events can lead to more landslides.

###### DROUGHTS
On the other side of the water spectrum are droughts, though they result from the same process. Droughts are a natural part of the climate cycle, but climate change is making them more frequent, severe, and prolonged. While higher levels of evaporation lead to eventual severe rainfall, in some regions, this shift means drier conditions due to the loss of the evaporated water, which can lead to drought and dried out soils and vegetation. With climate change, places that are traditionally dry are becoming drier through the higher levels of evaporation and places that are traditionally wet are becoming wetter through the higher levels of rainfall that result.

###### WILDFIRES
Wildfires are a consequence of the drier conditions caused by climate change in some areas. The wildfire season is much longer than in previous years and the number of wildfires per season has tripled. Severe heat and drought provide fuel for fires through drier soils and vegetation that is more flammable. Additionally, due to warmer temperatures, snowpacks are melting earlier, meaning that forests are drier for longer periods of time and increasingly at risk of fires.
